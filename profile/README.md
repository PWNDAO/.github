Welcome to the PWN DAO GitHub organization! Here you can find our open-source repositories and follow our progress.

## About PWN

**PWN is a peer-to-peer permissionless lending protocol.** 

In the true spirit of DeFi composability, PWN users can borrow against—or lend using—any asset in their wallet (ERC-20, NFT, and even a bundle of both), while enjoying absolute flexibility on the loan terms (LTV, duration, APR, etc.). 

The oracle-less nature of the protocol protects all PWN loans from price-based liquidations. The only way to lose collateral is to default on a loan.

PWN opens up new liquidity avenues, composability options, and leverage opportunities, while giving its users both optimized capital efficiency and predictability on both sides of the loan. A win on all fronts.
